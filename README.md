## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.io) - JS library
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) - Angular UI framework
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For backend database

### What I learned

Learned lots about building a CRUD app with Angular combined with Firebase. Also using Observables to communicate with components along with built in Angular animation libraries.

### Continued development

Looking to fine-tune more knowledge of Angular 16 latest features to do with new module systems. Looking at building project with this new approach in the near future.
